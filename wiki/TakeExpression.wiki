#summary Operation to take an element of a set

= Syntax =

If {{{S}}} is a [Sets set], then {{{ S x }}} is the value of an element of {{{S}}} unified to {{{x}}}

== High precedance ==

As the empty operator has a really strong precedence, {{{ a + b c + d }}} will be equivalent to {{{ a + (b c) + d }}} .

As a result, when the value taken out of the set is a complex expression, it has to be surrounded by parenthesis.

Therefore, it is better to quickly take the habit to use the C-like notation {{{ func(x + 1) }}}
