The assertion is mainly a preceder :
{{{ ? a }}} will :
* have the value {{{true}}} if {{{a}}} has the value {{{true}}}
* *fail* if {{{a}}} has the value {{{false}}}
* throw a semantic error if a is not a boolean

There is also a binary {{{?}}} that is a shortcut.
{{{ a ? b }}} is equivalent to {{{ ( ? a ) : b }}}

{{{ a ? b }}} means "If {{{a}}} then the value is {{{b}}}. If not, fail..."
