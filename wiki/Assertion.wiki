#summary From boolean value to control-flow
#labels Language

The assertion is mainly a preceder :
{{{ value ? condition }}} will :
* have the value {{{value}}} if {{{condition}}} has the value {{{true}}}
* *fail* if {{{condition}}} has the value {{{false}}}
* throw a semantic error if {{{condition}}} is not a boolean

Note:
This syntax has been choosen to keep the mathematical notation : the set of the naturals number smaller than 50 is written like this {{{ { x ? N x < 50 } }}}

The "drawback" is that the equivalent of the ternary C++ operator is inverted.

{{{ vTrue ? condition : vFalse }}} means {{{vTrue}}} if {{{condition}}} has the value {{{true}}} and {{{vFalse}}} if {{{condition}}} has the value {{{false}}}
