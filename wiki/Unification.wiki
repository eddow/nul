The unification is the main point of NUL.

Unification is _associative_ and _commutative_ .

The unification of two expressions fails if there is no way to have the two expressions equal (knowing that the two expression can be fuzzy)

{{{ ( _, 3 ) = ( 5, _ ) }}} will succeed and give the value {{{ 5, 3 }}}.

{{{ ( _, 3 ) = ( _, 5 ) }}} will fail.
