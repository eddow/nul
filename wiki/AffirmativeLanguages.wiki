#summary Theory: The characteristics of affirmative languages

Affirmative languages have been rarely used till now. Few "alife and kicking" example are LOGO, PROLOG and SQL.

In affirmative languages, you cannot "unset what you set before".
The C script saying " a = 2 ; a = 3 ; " is understood in C as to put 2 then 3 as value for "a".
For affirmatives language, the equivalent would be harmful : you state that "a" is 2, then you state that "a" is 3 ... or everybody knows that if "a" is 2, it cannot be 3 !

In imperative languages, "=" means "becomes"
In affirmative languages, "=" means "is" (was, has always been and will always be : "is")
