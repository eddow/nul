A `possibles` is a list of NulFuzzyObj. It is used to represent computed objects.

== !JavaScript representation ==

A `possibles` is an a array of JsNulFuzzyObj.

Knowing that `pp` means `Possible Parameter` and can be either of these :
|| JsNulObj[, JsNulKlg] || a fixed/fuzzy value ||
|| JsNulFuzzyObj || a fuzzy value ||
|| an array of JsNulFuzzyObj || a list of possibles ||

The `possibles` array define beside these methods :
|| and || function(`pp`) || Creates a list of `possibles` who are these unifiable to the given ones ||
|| or || function(`pp`) || Creates a list of `possibles` who are these or the given ones ||
|| maybe || function(`pp`) || Modifies this `possibles` so that they recognise also the given ones ||
|| set || function() || Get these possibles as a NulObjSet representation ||
