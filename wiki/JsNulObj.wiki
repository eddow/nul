#summary Internal representation of NUL objects
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

For some object, the nature is known (pairs, numbers, sets, ...)
We can also represent object whose nature is unknown (locals, attributes of other objects, ...)

The internal representation of NulObj are a !JavaScript object that have these :

== properties ==

|| attr || `[`Associative list`]` || A list of the nul.obj properties. Detailed in JsNulObjAttributes. This list is present only when the object has a known nature. ||

== methods ==

|| defined || function(klg) || Manage to get an object with a known nature ||
|| valAttr || function(string) || Gets the _value_ attribute of this object as a JsNulPossibles. ||
|| fctAttr || function(string, JsNulObj) || Gets the _functional_ attribute of this object, whose is applied the given object as a JsNulPossibles. ||


`defined` returns this JsNulObj if it is defined, a new JsNulObj if it can be defined in klg or nothing if it cannot be defined.
