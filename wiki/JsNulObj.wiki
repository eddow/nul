#summary Internal representation of NUL objects
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

For some object, the nature is known (pairs, numbers, sets, ...)
We can also represent object whose nature is unknown (locals, attributes of other objects, ...)

The internal representation of NulObj are a !JavaScript object that have elements :

== Attribute access ==

The known-nature objects have an `attr` associative list to sotre the attributes value. The other ones still implements atribute access functions.

|| attr || `[`Associative list`]` || A list of the nul.obj properties. Detailed in JsNulObjAttributes. This list is present only when the object has a known nature. ||
|| valAttr || function(string) || Gets the _value_ attribute of this object as a JsNulPossibles. ||
|| fctAttr || function(string, JsNulObj) || Gets the _functional_ attribute of this object, whose is applied the given object as a JsNulPossibles. ||

== Nature knowledge ==

|| defined || function(klg) || Manage to get an object with a known nature ||

`defined` returns this JsNulObj if it is defined, a new JsNulObj if it can be defined in klg or nothing if it cannot be defined.

== Cloneage and modification ==

|| getd || function(string) || Gets the JsNulObj attribute which name is given as parameter ||
|| modd || function(string `attr`, any `val`) || Returns the JsNulObj cloned for which the attribute `attr` now map to `val` ||

{{{obj.getd('a.b')}}} is equivalent to {{{obj.a.b}}}

== Distribution ==

Some JsNulObj reference other JsNulObj. It is possible though yo replace the reference to a JsNulObj by a reference to a JsNulPossibles.
*The object will be mostly unusable as is* but then, its `distribute` function will give you a list of possibles object, exactly as the original object beside the reference that became one of the possible JsNulObj reference.

|| distribute || function() || Get a list of fuzzy values from this object whose components were a list of fuzzy values ||
|| distributives || string array || (define by the object) list of the references to an object ||
