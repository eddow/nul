= Introduction =

For some object, the nature is known (pairs, numbers, sets, ...)
We can also represent object whose nature is unknown (locals, attributes of other objects, ...)

The internal representation of NulObj are a !JavaScript object that have these :

== properties ==

|| attr || `[`Associative list`]` || A list of the nul.obj properties. Detailed in JsNulObjAttributes. This list is present only when the object has a known nature. ||

== methods ==

|| isIn || function(JsNulObj) || Returns a JsNulPossibles of this object as it belongs to the one given. ||
