= Introduction =

Are implemented some native data-managing funtionalities. These are given as "global variables" (indeed, there is no such things as global variables, these are just variables declared as attribute of a fake over-root expression)


= Math =

Are defined two sets : Q, Z, respectively for the sets of rational numbers and integers.
These sets are non-transforming sets giving back the value or failing if the value don't fit.

Is also defined the set `bool`, containing - of course - two values.

= String =

Is defined the set {{{str}}} as the set of all strings.
This set is non-transforming set giving back the value or failing if the value is not a string.

= Objects =

As object sets will have to be defined by after, the native "object" set is still given to allow extensibility.
