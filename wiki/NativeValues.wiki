= Introduction =

Are implemented some native data-managing funtionalities. These are given as "global variables" (indeed, there is no such things as global variables, these are just variables declared as attribute of a fake over-root expression)


= Math =

These sets are non-transforming sets giving back the value or failing if the value don't fit.


= String =

Is defined the set {{{str}}} as the set of all strings.
This set is non-transforming set giving back the value or failing if the value is not a string.
