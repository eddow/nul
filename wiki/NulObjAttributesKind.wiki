= Introduction =

The NUL objects has several kinds of attributes

== Named attributes ==

The ones accessbile from their names : "`obj.X`" represent the attribute named `X` of the object `obj`

== Postcedor/precedor attributes ==

These attributes are like the named attributes in that they give an object for each object.
For instance, the precedor '-' is an attribute of the numbers who means the opposite number.

== binary operators ==

Binary operators are not commutative. Therefore, each object has to define how it reacts when it is left of a binary operator by giving a function `operand => value'

The expression `a - b` will be evaluated to `a.operator- [ b ]`

== N-ary operators ==

up to come. Let's make them binary first...
