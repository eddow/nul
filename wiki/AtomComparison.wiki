#summary Atom comparison

= Introduction =

Atom comparison is an asertion too : if the comparison turns out not to be verified, the expression fails (usually, the comparison returns a boolean, as the equality comparison)

Therefore, the return value of {{{a > b}}} is either {{{a}}} either a failure !

The grouping is as follow : {{{a > b > c}}} is grouped as {{{a > ( b > c )}}} - this allows to write ranges like {{{0 < x < 10}}}

Beside it, an ordered list always have the value of its first element, it can then be used in/out, like any other expression. For an example, here is the definition of the "naturals numbers" (integers bigger or equal to zero) : {{{N = { Z n >= 0 } }}}

The {{{a <= b}}} is just converted into {{{a < b [] a = b}}}

note: Once in the knowledge, only the 'lower than' operator is used. Therefore, objects have to define only this '<' operator to be sortable.
