Internal representation of NulJsSet.

= Description =

These are specifics objects defined in !JavaScript.

== Empty set ==

Syntax : *`{}`*
Contains nothing.

== Litterals sets ==

 * `Q` is the set f rational numbers.
 * `str` is the set of strings
 * `bool` is the set of booleans

== Ranges ==

Ranges define a set of integer numbers.

Syntax :
 * *`[..]`* : All the natural numbers.
 * *`[`*l*`..]`* : All the natural numbers bigger than `l`.
 * *`[..`*u*`]`* : All the natural numbers lower than `u`.
 * *`[`*l*`..`*u*`]`* : All the natural numbers between `l` and `u`.

`l` and `u` are direct values, not NUL expressions.

The components are `lower` and `upper` : they are numbers or the !Javascript value `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` or `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`.
