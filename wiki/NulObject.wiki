= Introduction =

The objects are the "values" NUL deal with. From simple object like {{{5}}} to complex ones like sets or {{{the attribute "length" of the unknown local "a"}}}, all the questions and knowledge is represented with Objects.

NUL can deal with 'defined' and 'undefined' objects.

The 'defined' objects are the ones we know the structure.
The undefined are the one we can find it out.
