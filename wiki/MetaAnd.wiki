The meta-and is a list of expressions that have to succeed (ie. not to fail).
The first component is the one that will be taken as value.

So, in english, {{{ a; b; c }}} means " {{{a}}} while {{{b}}} and {{{c}}} "

Note: the meta-and is not an expression builder. When it is used, it gives the meaning of the first expression and add the remainings to the present context predicates.

===== Example =====
{{{ a = b + 1 ; a + 5 }}} is equivalent to {{{b+6}}}. The context will have the predicate {{{a = b + 1}}}
