Some time, an expression has to refer itself - especially in recursion expression.

Let's build the factorial here.

the factorial 'contains' the number 1 (indeed, associate one to one - that's what that means)
For the other numbers (bigger than one), the factorial associate a number {{{n}}} to this number {{{n}}} multiplied by the factorial of {{{n-1}}}

So, if {{{f}}} is the set representing the factorial, the factorial can be expressed as :
{{{
{ 1
[] \/n n > 1 ?
     n :- n * f[n-1]
}
}}}

Now, the point is to link this definition to {{{f}}}, to say that this definition _is_ {{{f}}}

One intuitive way is to write {{{\/f f = { 1 [] \/n n > 1 ? n :- n * f[n-1] } }}} .

This way works, but there is a shortcut :

{{{ [f { 1 [] \/n n > 1 ? n :- n * f[n-1] }] }}}

so basically, {{{`[`f ...`]`}}} means that  {{{...}}} is an expression where {{{f}}} is the whole expression itself.
