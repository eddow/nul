#summary JavaScript representation of nul.obj attributes
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

The attributes of the nul.obj (stored in the property `attr` of the corresponding JS object) is an associative array.
The !JavaScript keys are the members name for NUL too.

== Attributes representation ==

In the !JavaScript attributes list, each attribute can have the state of an _evaluated attribute_ or an _atribute to evaluate_.

As seen in NulObjAttributesKind, there are two kinds of attributes : _value_ and _functional_.

If they are _evaluated attributes_, they are stored as direct values (either a nul.obj either a nul.set)
If they are still _attribute to evaluate_, they are represented in !JavaScript by a function.

The _value_ attributes will be represented by a function taking no arguments, the _functional_ attributes by a function taking one argument : it will be given the nul.obj used as second operand.
These functions will return JsNulPossibles.
